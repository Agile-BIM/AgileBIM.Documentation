# About this project
I've been building very advanced, custom AutoCAD and Revit functionality for a select group of clients for a very long time. The last 4 years have been a journey to finish evolving into a truly professional developer, with skills and knowledge that transcends typically Autodesk plugin development. So, it is time I that expand into a larger market.
